# NLP Techniques Repository

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and examples designed to help you understand and implement various NLP tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, you'll find useful code snippets, tutorials, and explanations to enhance your NLP projects.

## Contents

- **Text Preprocessing**: Learn how to clean and prepare text data for NLP tasks, including steps like tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and lemmatization. [Check out the example](https://github.com/Lanor-Jephthah1/NLP-Techniques/tree/58ca723b68482d16449274d5baa5c537e1154c00/NLP%20Text%20Preprocessing).

- **POS Tagging**: Understand how to perform Part-of-Speech tagging to identify the grammatical structure of sentences. This section includes examples and explanations of popular POS tagging techniques and tools.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Dive into Named Entity Recognition to extract meaningful entities from text, such as names, dates, and locations. This section provides examples and tutorials on implementing NER using various libraries.

- **Fake News Classifier Case Study**: Explore a complete case study on building a fake news classifier. This section covers data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to demonstrate how NLP can be applied to detect fake news. [Check out the case study](yet to release).
